# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### The purpose of this project was to analyze, condense, and visualize a dataset on Excel containing data from thousands of Kickstarter campaigns. The results of this analysis were used to help Louise have the most successuful fundraising campaign possible.

## Analysis and Challenges

### An analysis of outcomes based on the launch date of the campaigns was performed by quantifying the number successful, failed, and canceled campaings and organizing them by the months of the year they were started in. This was done by organizing them into a easy to read table and then transposing that inforation onto a chart for visualization (shown below).![Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch png](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79877531/111887101-f9d8dd80-898f-11eb-8ead-e65bdffb930b.png)

### We also performed an analysis of outcomes based on the goals of each campaign to see if there was any correlation between the goal and result of the campaign. This was done by quantifiyng the number of successful, failed, and canceled projects within a range of different dollar amount goals. These numbers were mined out of the dataset and organzied into a readable table and also transposed onto a chart for visualiization (shown below).![Outcomes_vs_Goals](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79877531/111887256-f4c85e00-8990-11eb-9500-a757a2cf2b6d.png)

### One of the main challenges was that the dataset included a lot of information that was irrelevant to Louise's project. The dataset had a lot of information on fundrasing campaigns on pojects that were different from ours such as TV shows and games. Analyzing this data would not have been useful because our client is specifically looking to raise money for a play. We had to work around this extra data by filtering it out and making our functions specific to the information that we needed.

## Results

- One conclusion we can make about outcomes based on launch date is that campaigns are most successful when launched in May or June, this is also when most campagins are launched. We can also conclude that the number of failed campaigns is relatively constant throught the whole year.

- A conclusion we can make from outcomes based on goals is that the higher the goal, the more likely a campaign will fail. We can also conclude that Louise will have the best chances of having a successful campaign if she keeps her goal below $15,000.

- One limitation of the dataset is how old the data is. The newest campaigns in the dataset are from 2017, with most of them being older than that. This makes the data at least 4 years old. The way online fundraising campagins work could have significanlty changed over that time period. 

- Another table/graph we could have created would be outcomes based on the country of origin. Another one could be outcomes based on the length of the campaign.
